# Getting to grips with working in terminal 

A lot of bioinformatics pipelines and softwares are run directly in terminal, familiarity with bash scripting will make learning these softwares hopefully a little easier 

A great resource, as always, is the Pyhton For Biologist webpage from Helfrid Hochegger.

Here is a link to the page specifically about bash:
